I thought I saw something in their patch series where they also had a
secret that got passed down from EFI?  As I remember they had it with an
ioctl and something; but it felt to me if it would be great if it was
shared.

Yeh. SNP is a whole different question.

I'd love to hear from those other cloud vendors; I've not been able to
find any detail on how their SEV(-ES) systems actually work.

However, this aims to be just a comms mechanism to pass that secret;
so it's pretty low down in the stack and is there for them to use -
hopefully it's general enough.
(An interesting question is what exactly gets passed in this key and
what it means).

All the contentious stuff I've seen seems to be further up the stack - like
who does the attestation and where they get the secrets and how they
know what a valid measurement looks like.
