Well, I've always thought it was silly ever since it was introduced:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ed8b0de5a33d2a2557dce7f9429dca8cb5bc5879

The rationale it was because root could brick their system by doing rm
-fr never made any sense, since if root is going to do rm -fr they're
asking to become unbootable anyway.

All of us who have code that manipulates the variables simply added
remove immutable flag code like the above.  If it does get removed,
efivarfs will still need to respond to get/setfsxattr though to make
sure that code keeps working, so it can't be a clean revert.

Regards,

James
