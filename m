Urgent

I am Mrs. Selvia Santiago from Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire, I am a widow
suffering from long time illness (Cancer), there is funds I inherited
from my late loving husband Mr. Santiago Carlos, the sum of (US$2.7
Million Dollars) which he deposited in bank before his death, I need a
honest and Faithful person that can use these funds for humanity work.

I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this money and I don't want a situation where this money will be used
in an ungodly way. That is why I am taking this decision, and my
doctor has confirmed to me that I have less than two weeks to live,
having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a charity
or individual that will utilize this money to assist the poor and the
needy in accordance to my instructions.

I want you to use 70% of this funds for orphanages, school, church,
widows, propagating the word and other humanity works,The remaining
30% should be yours for your efforts as the new beneficiary.

Please if you would be able to use these funds for humanity work
kindly reply me. As soon as I have received your response, I will give
you further directives on how you are to go about the claims of the
said funds.

Remain blessed.
Mrs Selvia Santiago.
