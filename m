Good Day Dear Friend,
I am sincerely writing this mail to you, to seek for your urgent
assistance in this humanitarian social investment project to be
establish in your country for the mutual benefit of the orphans and
the less privileged ones. However I believe that you and I can
cooperate together in this service of the Lord, which I'm pleading to
you to kindly open your heart to assist me in carrying out this
benevolent project in your country/position. I am Mrs. Dee Parson's, a
dying widow hospitalized undergoing treatment for brain tumor disease,
I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence
that I am about to entrust to you for the mutual benefit of the
orphans and the less privileged ones. My late husband made a
substantial deposit with the Bank which I have decided to hand over
and entrust the sum of ($ 12,500,000.00 Dollars) in the account under
your custody for you to invest it into any social charitable project
in your location or your country. Based on my present health status I
am permanently indisposed to handle finances or any financial related
project.

This is the reason why I decided to contact you for your support and
help to stand as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for
humanitarian purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged
ones. Because If the fund remains unclaimed with the bank after my
death, those greedy bank executives will place the fund as an
unclaimed Fund and share it among themselves for their selfish and
worthless ventures. In this regard I need your sincerity and ability
to carry out this transaction and fulfill my final wish in
implementing the charitable investment project in your country as it
requires absolute trust and devotion without any failure. Meanwhile It
will be my pleasure to compensate you with part of the total money as
my Investment manager/partner for your effort in handling the
transaction, while the remaining amount shall be invested into any
charity project of your choice there in your country or any part of
the world for the mutual benefits of the less privileged ones.

Your early response will be appreciated to enable me to send you
further details of the transaction.

May God bless you.
Mrs. Dee Parson's.
