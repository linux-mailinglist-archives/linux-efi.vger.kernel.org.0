I don't beleve that's a valid check anymore since Gerd introduced the
ability to load UEFI via -bios, for UEFI builds without persistent
variables. ( a8152c4e4613c70c2f0573a82babbc8acc00cf90 )

Yep, and ultimately the inability to distinguish UEFI vs other firmware
is arguably correct by design, as the QEMU <-> firmware interface is
supposed to be arbitrarily pluggable for any firmware implementation
not  limited to merely UEFI + seabios.

Having it opt-in via a knob would defeat Jason's goal of having the seed
available automatically.
