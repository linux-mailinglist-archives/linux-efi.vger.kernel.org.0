See below, there is already an existing TPM app driver [2] in kernel 
although the app is based on OP-TEE.

The Linux TEE framework already provides an in-kernel interface to TEE 
as well via TEE bus [1]. There are already multiple kernel drivers [2] 
[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] using it. So an EFI driver can be an addition to that.

Now coming on to TEE implementations, the drivers I mentioned are based 
on OP-TEE where devices are queried/enumerated during OP-TEE probe here 
[8]. So in similar manner QTEE smcinvoke driver should be able to 
register devices on the TEE bus.

PS. TBH, I haven't looked into detail workings for the QTEE smcinvoke 
driver.
